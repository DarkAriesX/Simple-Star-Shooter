# Asteroids
This is my first game! When I was making this game, I learned how to use SFML library, multi-threads and why is using git important ;)

# Requirement
* Computer
* SFML (install for linux bellow; install on other systems soon)
* Brain (minimum 3 brain cells)
* Two hands
* G++ compilator
* Eyes
* Optionally ears
* cmake (install for linux bellow; install on other systems soon)
* Now xbox-like controller, but I will add keyboard support soon (I swear... DONATE ME ON PATREON PLEASE)

# Install
## Linux:
### Installing SFML and cmake
To play my game, you must install first SFML library and cmake.
##### In Arch-based distros:
`
sudo pacman -S sfml cmake
`
##### In Debian-based distros:
`
sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev cmake
`
### Building a game
I made a simple script to install (build) game, but if you want you can build it on your own.
##### Using a script:
`./install.sh`
##### And building by yourself:

`mkdir build/`

`cd build/`

`cmake ..`

`make`

## Windows:
Soon...

# Controls
Now my game must be played with controler, but in the future I will add keyboard support.
Personally recommend to use a xbox-like controlers.

Rotete to right - RB - Right Arrow
